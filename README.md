### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Symone! I'm a data scientist who is passionate about making anxiety friendly apps and widgets. 
I'm currently working on the anxious to-do list, a to-do list to help anxious people priotize their day-to-day activites and chores. 

- You can find me designing widgets and buttons on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/symxing)
